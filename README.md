## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how *box-sizing: border-box;* can be useful:

```css
.card {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
Also discovered how to write bold text with just html5:

```html
<b><h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1></b>
```

### Continued development

I'm now understanding the basic concepts of HTML5 and CSS3, but I still need practice. 
*Good practice makes you perfect*.

### Useful resources

- [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped to find and understand every property in css and every tag in html5.
